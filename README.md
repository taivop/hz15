Sencis.co is a platform for tracking the ambience of rooms using cheap and abundant sensors. Use cases range from improving the 'feels good' factor at hotels to increasing employee well-being in offices.

Features:
* Plugs into Ethernet port -- no extra infrastructure (other than a compatible router) is needed.
* Sensor results are stored and an HTTP API is provided for interfacing with analytics/business intelligence systems.
* Real-time data visualisation (1-second delay).

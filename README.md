# sencis.co

Sencis.co is a platform for tracking the ambience of rooms using cheap and abundant sensors. Use cases range from improving the 'feels good' factor at hotels to increasing employee well-being at offices.

Features:
* Visual overview of rooms and real-time data visualisations.
* Sensor box plugs into Ethernet port -- no extra infrastructure is needed (other than a compatible router).
* Sensor results are stored and an HTTP API is provided for interfacing with analytics/business intelligence systems.

See demo at [demo.sencis.co](http://demo.sencis.co/suite.html)! In the demo, only room [Suite](http://demo.sencis.co/suite.html) has actual tracking data; other rooms' data is simulated.
